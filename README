This repository contains my current .emacs file, along with the associated vendor / elisp files.  
It's meant to allow me to pull my .emacs configuration from anywhere.  While it's mostly meant
for my personal convenience, you may find it useful.  If you do, let me know!

Also, this repository is subject to massive and constant change (I'm tweaking things constantly)
and experimenting with new modes and packages.  Don't depend on any real stability from what you
find here.
